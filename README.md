### Variable Rewards
By giving rewards unpredictably, users will be more motivated to invoke the action that gives the reward. In this case, we should expect users are more motivated to answer questions to get the reward of finding another user's answer.  
(C) CUE: Hidden User's Answer.  
(A) ACTION: Answer Question.  
(R) REWARD: Reveal User's Answer. 

### Goal-Gradient & Set Completion
(1) User will be motivated to complete a set and move have more motivation as they are closer to the goal. As a user answers questions, they should be motivated to answer all the questions available.
